Ok this is slightly ridiculous.
Ros kinetic uses  PCL 1.7 by default and in all its nodes
from package pcl_ros and such.
PCL 1.7 is incompatible with c++11 so that is not nice. But pcl 1.8 is!.
So PCL nodes can be compiled in 1.8.

Cuda does not by defaults supports c++ 11 but it does it can be easily configured to do such -std=c++11
After all nvcc is a gcc fork

The PCD file estructure varies from 1.7 to 1.8 that is why all the colors are messed up!
On top of that my source installation of PCL 1.8 shadows
PCL 1.7

Please kill me...
